## üéØ **Daily Itinerary Enhancements**

### **1. Enhanced Itinerary Generator (`EnhancedItineraryGenerator`)**

**Location**: `src/ai_agents/enhanced_itinerary_generator.py`

**Key Features**:
- **Supabase Activities Integration**: Actively fetches from the `activities` table
- **Context-Aware Planning**: Considers time of day, travel logistics, and user energy levels
- **Anti-Repetition System**: Tracks used activities to ensure variety
- **Cultural Intelligence**: Provides cultural etiquette tips and local insights
- **Budget-Aware Filtering**: Matches activities to user's budget preferences

**Technical Implementation**:
```python
class EnhancedItineraryGenerator:
    def generate_intelligent_daily_itinerary(self, destination, duration, profile, user_prompt, package_style):
        # Fetches from Supabase activities table
        destination_activities = self._fetch_destination_activities(destination)
        
        # Analyzes user interests from profile + prompt
        user_interests = self._analyze_user_interests(profile, user_prompt)
        
        # Creates progression strategy avoiding repetition
        itinerary_strategy = self._create_itinerary_strategy(duration, user_interests, package_style)
        
        # Generates unique daily plans with contextual awareness
        return self._generate_contextual_day_plans(...)
```

### **2. Supabase Activities Table Integration**

**Database Query**:
```sql
SELECT id, name, description, category, duration_hours, price_range,
       difficulty_level, best_time_of_day, season_availability,
       cultural_significance, insider_tips, booking_required
FROM activities 
WHERE destination = ? AND category IN (user_interests)
```

**Intelligent Filtering**:
- **Interest Matching**: Filters activities based on user's stated interests
- **Budget Compatibility**: Excludes activities outside user's budget range
- **Time Optimization**: Considers best time of day for each activity
- **Difficulty Matching**: Matches activity difficulty to user preferences

### **3. Enhanced Daily Plan Structure**

Each day now includes:
```json

    "activity": "Louvre Museum Private Tour",
    "details": "Expert-guided tour avoiding crowds",

  ],
  "photography_opportunities": [

### **4. Fallback System**
