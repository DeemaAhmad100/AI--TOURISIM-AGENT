## 🛡️ Security Best Practices

### For Users
1. **API Keys**: Always keep your API keys secure and never commit them to version control
2. **Environment Variables**: Use `.env` files for sensitive configuration
3. **Updates**: Keep dependencies updated regularly
4. **Access Control**: Limit database access to necessary permissions only

### For Developers
1. **Input Validation**: Always validate and sanitize user inputs
2. **SQL Injection**: Use parameterized queries
3. **Authentication**: Implement proper authentication mechanisms
4. **HTTPS**: Always use HTTPS in production
5. **Secrets Management**: Use proper secrets management systems
